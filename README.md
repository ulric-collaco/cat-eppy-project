# Survey Platform â€” Employer & Student Surveys

Lightweight React app to collect and manage two survey types: Employer surveys (employers hiring from the program) and Student surveys (graduates / trainees). Designed for quick data collection, image upload via Cloudinary, and local or server-side storage.

## What this project does

- Displays survey forms tailored for Employers and Students.
- Uploads an optional image with each survey (Cloudinary).
- Persists survey results (localStorage by default; API endpoints available for server storage).
- Provides a dashboard to view, filter and delete surveys and to export or inspect data.
- Minimal user login (select a user name) for quick testing.
